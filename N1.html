        <title>Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds</title>
        Noel Gallagher is a British musician, singer, and songwriter best known as the lead guitarist and primary songwriter of the rock band Oasis. Born on May 29, 1967, in Manchester, England, Noel played a pivotal role in shaping the band's sound and contributing to their massive success during the Britpop movement in the 1990s.

As the older brother of Oasis's lead vocalist, Liam Gallagher, Noel had a significant impact on the band's dynamic with his distinctive songwriting style, melodic guitar riffs, and memorable lyrics. His compositions often featured catchy melodies and anthemic choruses, with notable contributions to iconic albums like "Definitely Maybe" and "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?"

Noel's role extended beyond his instrumental and songwriting talents; he was also a key figure in the public image of Oasis. His tumultuous relationship with Liam, marked by sibling rivalry and public disputes, became a defining aspect of the band's narrative. In 2009, following years of internal conflicts, Noel Gallagher left Oasis, leading to the band's eventual breakup.

After Oasis, Noel formed the band Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds and continued his successful career as a solo artist. His solo work showcased a more diverse musical range while maintaining his distinct voice as a songwriter. Noel Gallagher remains a prominent figure in the music industry, celebrated for his contributions to the Britpop era and his enduring influence on subsequent generations of musicians.
