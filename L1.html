        <title>Liam Gallagher</title>
        Liam Gallagher, born on September 21, 1972, is an English singer and songwriter widely recognized as the charismatic frontman of the iconic rock band Oasis. Hailing from Manchester, Liam played a pivotal role in defining the Britpop era during the 1990s alongside his older brother Noel Gallagher, who served as the band's chief songwriter.

        Known for his distinctive voice and rebellious attitude, Liam became a symbol of the raw energy and swagger that characterized Oasis' music. The band's debut album, "Definitely Maybe," released in 1994, marked a turning point in the British music scene, with Liam's vocals contributing to the anthemic quality of tracks like "Live Forever" and "Rock 'n' Roll Star."

        Liam's onstage presence, characterized by his tambourine-shaking and iconic stance, became synonymous with the band's electrifying performances. The success of their second album, "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" in 1995, further solidified Liam's status as a rock star. Hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger" showcased his emotive singing style.

        Throughout Oasis' career, Liam and Noel's tumultuous relationship, both on and off the stage, garnered significant media attention. The sibling rivalry and public feuds contributed to the band's narrative. Oasis disbanded in 2009, leading Liam to pursue a solo career.

        Post-Oasis, Liam continued to captivate audiences with his solo projects, including the formation of the band Beady Eye and subsequent solo albums like "As You Were" (2017) and "Why Me? Why Not" (2019). Liam Gallagher remains a prominent figure in the world of rock, celebrated for his enduring impact on British music and his unapologetic rock 'n' roll persona.
